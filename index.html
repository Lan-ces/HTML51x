                    <p>This site was created based on the edX course HTML5 Coding Essentials and Best Practices by W3C.</p>
                    <p>The course did not have a main project that you built on throughout it so I created my own. I decided to summarize the course contents in this format while using the concepts presented in the course to create it.</p>
                    <p>There is some cool optional projects in the course which are listed below.</p>

                    <p>HTML5 has many new structural elements. These elements are &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;time&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;figure&gt;, &lt;figcaption&gt; and &lt;main&gt;.</p>
                    <p>You can have multiple elements of most of these and can nest most of them inside each other. You can only have one main. Below is a code tree that shows the basic structure of this site. As you can see, there is a header and footer in the body as well as each article. There are several sections and each section has several articles. It only has one aside but you could have one for each article or section if it made sense. Each section or article can have its own nav etc.</p>

                        <h3>Sectioning Elements and Headings</h3>
                        <time datetime="2017-12-17">December 17, 2017</time>
                    </header>
                    <p>Headings &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; implicitly section a document while the new tags section, article, nav and aside explicitly section a document.</p>
                    <p>The HTML5 specification says that "each sectioning element potentially has a heading and has also an outline associated".</p>
                    <p>There are many browser extensions that will show an outline of your document as seen in the image below. Just search for HTML5 outliner.</p>
                    <div class="example">
                        <img src="img/outliner.jpg" alt="Image of outliner extension output.">
                    </div>
                    <p>The image is for this page as it was when this was written. There are some duplicate section and article names as temporary placeholders. More important to note is is the "Untitled" ASIDE. It shows that way because the aside did not have a &lt;h1&gt;..&lt;h6&gt; tag at the time and thus needed one added.</p>
                    <p>You may notice that the nav bar has a title and that it is visible. Sometimes you will not want a nav to have a visible heading and it is recommended to position it off screen rather that using display: none or visibility: hidden. This is a better option for assistive technologies. See <a href="https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2012/05/html5-accessibility-chops-hidden-and-aria-hidden/" target="_blank">this</a> article.</a></p>

                    <p>Accordian content is not a new thing but the &lt;details&gt; and &lt;summary&gt; elements make it easy. Here is an example that only contains text but it could contain a form, images and more.</p>
                    <details>
                        <summary>This is the summary.</summary>
                        <p>This is the additional content.</p>
                    </details>
                    <p>Here is the code that created the above accordian.</p>
                    <div class="code" w3-include-html="snippet/details-summary.html"></div>
                    <p>As of this writing Edge and some older browsers do not support this and here is one of the many polyfills you can add to the head of your document to add support.</p>
                    <div class="code">&lt;script src="js/details-element-polyfill.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</div>

                    <p>The &lt;time&gt; element is useful for marking time or durarion in a document. It has a human readable part and a machine readable part. The dates on these articles use it. Check it out on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_time.asp" target="_blank">w3schools</a>.</p>
                    <p>The &lt;mark&gt; element <mark>highlights</mark> part of your document like a highlighter and can be styled with CSS. Check it out on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_mark.asp" target="_blank">w3schools</a>.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>The download attribute can be used to force a link to be downloaded rather than displayed. Example below.</p>
                    <a href="img/HTML5_Logo_512.png" download="html5logo.png">Download HTML5 Logo</a>
                    <p>Here is the code.</p>
                    <div class="code">&lt;a href="img/HTML5_Logo_512.png" download="html5logo.png"&gt;Download HTML5 Logo&lt;/a&gt;</div>
                    <p>The translate attribute can be set to yes or no and can be used so that translation tools do not translate certain parts of your document. One example is that it would not make sense to translate code blocks like on this page.</p>
                    <p>I could manually add this attribute to all code blocks but I figured it would be easier and more interesting to use javascript. Here is the code.</p>

                    <p>Adding microdata to web pages helps search engines to better understand the pages' content, their topics, etc. The main purpose of microdata is Search Engine Optimization although it can be used for other purposes as well.</p>
                    <p>These articles are supposed to be brief introductions and not full tutorials. Hopefully the articles will give you a taste and make you want to search out more information. A proper covering of microdata would be way too long so I present you <a href="http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/extensibility.html" target="_blank">this</a> page as one option.</p>
                    <p>At the time of writing this I have not added any microdata to this page.</p>

                        <h3>The &lt;video&gt; Element</h3>
                        <time datetime="2017-12-18">December 18, 2017</time>
                    </header>
                    <p>The &lt;video&gt; element allows you to embed video in your page without complex code or Flash. The video below is the first minute of <a href="https://peach.blender.org/" target="_blank">Big Buck Bunny</a> used under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0</a> license.</p>
                    <video width="640" height="360" controls poster="img/big-buck-bunny.png" preload="none"> 
                        <source src=video/big_buck_bunny.webm type=video/webm /> 
                        <source src=video/big_buck_bunny.ogv type=video/ogg /> 
                        <source src=video/big_buck_bunny.mp4 type=video/mp4 />
                        Your browser does not support the &lt;video&gt; element.
                    </video>
                    <p>Sample code. Providing multiple sources is good as some browsers only support certain formats. The poster is an optional image to display when loaded. The controls attribute is to display controls to play, stop, etc.</p>
                    <p>The preload attribute can be set to none, metadata or auto. It is only valid if the autoplay attribute is not used. I used none here so it did not delay loading of other items. Notice the time does not show a duration.</p>
                    <div class="code" w3-include-html="snippet/video.html"></div>
                    <p>Note: You cannot directly embed videos from most social web sites such as YouTube, Dailymotion etc. They have different embed scripts.</p>

                    <p>The &lt;audio&gt; element is similar to the &lt;video&gt; element without the video related attributes like poster.</p>
                    <audio controls="controls" preload="metadata" loop>
                        <source src="audio/horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
                        <source src="audio/horse.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
                        <p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
                        <p>Download the audio/video in <a href="audio/horse.ogg">OGG</a> or <a href="audio/horse.mp3">MP3</a> format.</p>
                    </audio>
                    <p>The above element was done using the below code. Notice how it is very similar. The controls attribute was given a value in this one but it will work the same with any value or no value. Also note that there are download links provided in case the &lt;audio&gt; element is not supported.</p>
                    <p>In this example I used the metadata value for preload thus it knows the duraion. I also used the loop attribute so the audio continuously loops when playing.</p>
                    <div class="code" w3-include-html="snippet/audio.html"></div>
                    <p>You can style the &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; elements using CSS and JS. Here are some links to some examples.</p>

                    <p>You can control many aspects of &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements from Javascript. First you have to either select an element from the DOM or create one.</p>
                    <p>Once you have an element stored in a variable, let's say vid, you can manipulate its methods like play(), pause() etc. (eg. vid.play();)</p>
                    <p>You can manipulate its properties such as source, duration, current position and volume. (eg. vid.controls = true;)</p>
                    <p>You can respond to events using callbacks such as when it starts or ends or gets paused.</p>
                    <p>Check out <a href="https://www.w3.org/2010/05/video/mediaevents.html" target="_blank">this</a> page for a demonstration of many of these.</p>

                    <p>The &lt;track&gt; element allows you to add captions, subtitles, descriptions and metadata to your videos. The WebVTT format is used for describing a track file.</p>
                    <p>The &lt;track&gt; element has a kind attribute. The kind attribute can be subtitles, captions, descriptions, chapters or metadata. (eg. kind="subtitles")</p>
                    <p>Another attribute is default which is used to select the default track if more than one is provided.</p>
                    <p>The label attribute is what will be displayed to the user in the default HTML5 video player. (eg. label="English Subtitles")</p>
                    <p>There is a srclang attribute to specify the langage. (eg. srlang="en")</p>

                        <h3>The &lt;canvas&gt; Element</h3>
                        <time datetime="2017-12-20">December 20, 2017</time>
                    </header>
                    <p>The canvas can be used for drawing pixel based graphics for graphs, game graphics and other images on the fly.</p>
                    <p>It supports drawing many shapes including lines, rectangles, ellipses, arcs, curves, text and images.</p>
                    <p>The canvas can handle doing animations at 60 frames per second and has very good support in almost all major browsers.</p>
                    <p>The canvas coordinate system uses (0, 0) as the top left corner like many others.</p>
                    <p>Here is my canvas. I added a border around it for visualization purposes. It is 600 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall.</p>
                    <canvas id="myCanvas" width="600" height="300">Canvas is disabled or not supported.</canvas>
                    <p>Make sure the JS isn't called until you know the page is loaded using onload or similar. We store the canvas in a variable and then define a context for it.</p>
                    <p>Then we draw some rectangles. The fillStyle determines the color of filled rectangles and the strokeStyle determines the color of the wireframe ones.</p>
                    <p>Notice how the rectangles stack on top of each other in the order they are drawn, how you can see behind the wireframe ones and the second strokeRect uses the color previously set.</p>
                    <p>We also have a clearRect which pokes a hole in the green rectangle.</p>
                    <p>The drawMonster function just draws some rectangles the same way. Notice that when I draw it at (0, 0) it is not in the top left because of the translate before it.</p>
                    <p>Also notice that the next translate is based on the new coordinate system of the first translate.</p>
                    <p>The second time we draw the monster using the same call but it appears differently because of the transformations.</p>
                    <p>Doing the translate, rotate and scale in a different order would have a different result. This is the order recommended most of the time.</p>
                    <p>Notice the last rectangle is drawn in the same spot the second monster starts and it is purple because the last thing drawn on the monster is the mouth which is purple.</p>
                    <div class="code" w3-include-html="snippet/canvas1.html"></div>
                    <p>When doing transformations or calling functions that will change the context it is a good idea to save the current context so it can be restored.</p>
                    <p>This is done using ctx.save(); and ctx.restore(); and is good practice to save at the start of a function and restore at the end of a function.</p>
                    <p>Note: These rectangles as well as text and images are drawn in "immediate mode". "Path mode" or "buffered mode" is used for lines, arcs, curves and can also be used for rectangles. We'll see that later.</p>

                    <p>You can draw text on the canvas with fillText and strokeText. You can specify how the text is drawn using the font property of the context. The font property is CSS-compliant ant thus you can specify the style, weight, size and face.</p>
                    <canvas id="myCanvas2" width="600" height="300">Canvas is disabled or not supported.</canvas>
                    <p>You can see in the code below how we draw strokeText on top of fillText to give the ext a border. You can also see how we specify font properties in different ways.</p>
                    <p>The last example uses the optional last parameter of maxWidth to constarin the text to the width specified.</p>
                    <p>The part in the middle measures the text and then draws a baseline under it with the legth of the text's width.</p>
                    <div class="code" w3-include-html="snippet/canvas2.html"></div>
                    <p>You can also change the way the text is drawn horizontally with the textBaseline property and the horizontal alignment with the textAlign property.

                        <h3>Drawing Images on the Canvas</h3>
                        <time datetime="2017-12-21">December 21, 2017</time>
                    </header>
                    <p>Images must be fully loaded before they are drawn. For this reason they are loaded asynchronously in the background </p>
                    <canvas id="myCanvas3" width="600" height="300">Canvas is disabled or not supported.</canvas>
                    <p>In the code below we create an Image object and set up an onload callback. At the bottom we specify the source which stsrts loading the image. Once it is loaded the onload callback gets called.</p>
                    <p>In the callback we draw the image three diferent ways. The first is in the top corner with a width and height of 100. The second starts from the bottom corner of the first and has a width and height of 200.</p>
                    <p>The third is a little different. It selects a portion of the original starting at (50,0) with dimensions of (400,100) and then draws it on the canvas at (300,0) with dimensions of (175,50).</p>
                    <div class="code" w3-include-html="snippet/canvas3.html"></div>
                    <p>The image source can also be a video stream, another canvas or an &lt;img&gt; element.</p>

                    <p>Path drawing mode is faster than immediate mode and can be used for drawing many things.</p>
                    <canvas id="myCanvas4" width="400" height="200">Canvas is disabled or not supported.</canvas>
                    <p>In the code below you see the path mode version of drawing rectangles. Note that when I draw the third rectangle, the red wireframe, that it also redraws the previous rectangle as a red wireframe as well.</p>
                    <p>This is because it is still in the buffer since we did not call beginPath in between them. Also note that only two lines of the triangle are specifically drawn. The other is drawn because of the closePath line.</p>

                    <p>Here is an example of drawing using the alpha channel and drawing using a gradient.</p>
                    <canvas id="myCanvas5" width="600" height="300">Canvas is disabled or not supported.</canvas>
                    <p>The first part of the code draws three rectangles using different values for the transparency.</p>
                    <p>I then create a rainbow gradient. The first line determines the placement and direction of the gradient. The color stops define the colors it uses. I then set the fillStyle to this gradient and draw some rectangles to show what gets displayed.</p>
                    <div class="code" w3-include-html="snippet/canvas5.html"></div>
                    <p>You can also apply gradients to stroke objects and create radial gradients. You can use shadows and style lines.</p>

                <h2>HTML5 Animations</h2>
                <article>
                    <header>
                        <h3>Basic Animation in the Canvas</h3>
                        <time datetime="2017-12-22">December 22, 2017</time>
                    </header>
                    <p>Basic animation consists of clearing the screen/canvas, drawing something on it, change some property of it and then repeat. Doing this fast enough will result in aniimation. An animation done at 60 frames per second (fps) can be smoother then one done at 30fps.</p>
                    <p>Before HTML5 and canvas this was done using divs, css backgrounds and positioning as well as Javascript.</p>
                    <p>The two methods used for animation were setinterval(function, ms) and setTimeout(function, ms). The diference in these is that seInterval will run every n milliseconds where setTimeout will run once after n milliseconds and you would generally call it again at the end of the function.</p>
                    <p>The new HTML5 method is requestAnimationFrame(function). There is no second parameter as it is set to 16.6ms to produce a 60fps animation.</p>
                    <p>Below I set up three canvas elements and put CSS borders around them so you can see where they are. The first uses setInterval, the second uses setTimeout and the third uses requestAnimationFrame to animate a rectangle.</p>
                    <canvas id="myCanvas6-1" width="200" height="100">Canvas is disabled or not supported.</canvas>
                    <canvas id="myCanvas6-2" width="200" height="100">Canvas is disabled or not supported.</canvas>
                    <canvas id="myCanvas6-3" width="200" height="100">Canvas is disabled or not supported.</canvas>
                    <p>As you can see in the code below, animation is not that difficult. We get the canvas and context as usual. We set the starting X of the rectangle and the number of pixels to move (speed) each update. Then we simply call one of the three animation funcions with a callback that does the update.</p>
                    <p>In the animate function we clear the canvas, draw the rectangle and then update the position for the next call. Since setTimeout and requestAnimationFrame only run once we call them again at the end of the function.</p>
                    <p>I have setInterval being called every 33ms, about 30fps, setTimeout at 22ms, about 45fps and requestAnimationFrame runs at about 60fps as long as the system it is running on can support that rate.</p>
                    <div class="code" w3-include-html="snippet/canvas6.html"></div>
                    <p>setInterval will execute the function passed as first parameter every n milliseconds regardless of when the function was last called or how long the function takes to execute. If the function takes longer than the interval, then setInterval might queue too many function executions back to back when the interval is too short, leading to unpredictable results.</p>
                    <p>setTimeout solves thi issue since it only runs once and is not called again until the end of the callback. However, both have problems with no being very prcise in their timing which may be noticeable in some situations.</p>
                    <p>requestAnimationFrame uses a high resolution timer which makes it more accurate, it also provides an extra parameter to the callback which is a high resolution time. It is useful in time-based animation which can account for any difference in the timing.</p>
                    <p>Check out <a href="https://jsbin.com/jukoniz/1/edit?html,output" target="_blank">this</a> link for an animation that uses start and stop buttons, transformations and shows where the timestamp mentioned above comes from although it is not used.</p>
